# DataStructures-Algorithms-Python

Welcome to the **DataStructures-Algorithms-Python** repository!

This repository documents my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Python. It includes over 100 hand-crafted animated HD videos to help illustrate key concepts in a clear and engaging way. The repository covers both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Technical Concepts
- **Big O Notation:** Learn to analyze algorithm efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.

### 2. Data Structures
- **Lists:** Basics and operations of Python lists.
- **Linked Lists:** Understanding singly linked lists and their operations.
- **Doubly Linked Lists:** Exploring doubly linked list structures and differences from singly linked lists.
- **Stacks & Queues:** Principles and practical applications.
- **Binary Trees:** Introduction and traversal techniques.
- **Hash Tables:** Hash functions, collision handling, and operations.
- **Heaps:** Structure, operations, and uses.
- **Graphs:** Representations, traversal techniques, and algorithms.

### 3. Algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - **Bubble Sort**: Understanding the basics and implementation.
  - **Selection Sort**: Sorting by selection and finding the minimum element.
  - **Insertion Sort**: Sorting by inserting elements into the correct position.
  - **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm for efficient sorting.
  - **Quick Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm based on partitioning.
- **Searching Algorithms:**
  - **Breadth First Search (BFS):** Exploring the breadth of a graph level by level.
  - **Depth First Search (DFS):** Exploring the depth of a graph path by path.

Each section includes detailed explanations, code examples, and practical exercises to reinforce learning. This repository is an excellent resource for anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms using Python.
